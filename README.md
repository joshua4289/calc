This is my first sample go project 
Things learnt:
1. The easy thing is to put under a github repo this is because go needs a ','(dot) in the module name

2. here the module name is the whole github.com/usernme/repo

3. We are still not using the local file-system instead of git . Need to understand the "replace" directive first

4. replace is a go.mod directive
